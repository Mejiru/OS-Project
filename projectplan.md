Week 2 (Nov 8 – 14): Banker’s Algorithm

Read process/resource data, allocation, max, and available matrices.

Compute Need Matrix and check safe sequence.

Implement request handling and matrix updates.

✅ Deliverable: Fully working Banker’s algorithm with safe state detection.

Week 3 (Nov 15 – 21): Page Replacement Algorithms

Implement FIFO, Optimal, and LRU.

Input: frame size, reference string.

Output: page faults, hit/miss ratios.

✅ Deliverable: Working page replacement module with comparison of results.

Week 4 (Nov 22 – 28): Integration & Documentation

Combine all modules under one main menu.

Clean up input/output and formatting.

Write README (compilation/run instructions) and report with screenshots.

Include all required outputs and sample runs.

✅ Deliverable: Complete program + polished report ready for review.

Week 5 (Nov 29 – Dec 1): Testing & Presentation

Final testing with multiple datasets.

Prepare and rehearse project presentation/demo.

Submit source code, report, README, screenshots by Dec 1 (no zip files).

Bring hard copy for in-class presentation.

✅ Deliverable: Fully functional project submitted and presented.
